    "## MAGIC METHOD\n",
    "\n",
    "In object-oriented programming, a magic method (also known as a dunder method, short for \"double underscore\") is a special method in Python that starts and ends with double underscores (__). These methods are automatically invoked by the interpreter in certain situations, enabling you to define custom behavior for built-in operations or special functions in a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common Magic Methods:\n",
    "Initialization and Representation:\n",
    "\n",
    "__init__(self): Called when a new instance of the class is created (constructor). It allows you to initialize attributes.\n",
    "__str__(self): Defines the string representation of an object for readability, like when passed to print().\n",
    "__repr__(self): Provides an unambiguous string representation of the object, often used for debugging.\n",
    "Arithmetic Operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "__add__(self, other): Defines the behavior for the + operator.\n",
    "__sub__(self, other): Defines the behavior for the - operator.\n",
    "__mul__(self, other): Defines the behavior for the * operator.\n",
    "__truediv__(self, other): Defines the behavior for the / operator.\n",
    "Comparison Operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "__eq__(self, other): Called for the equality operator (==).\n",
    "__lt__(self, other): Called for the less than operator (<).\n",
    "__gt__(self, other): Called for the greater than operator (>).\n",
    "Attribute Access and Management:\n",
    "\n",
    "__getattr__(self, name): Called when trying to access an attribute that doesn't exist.\n",
    "__setattr__(self, name, value): Called when setting an attribute.\n",
    "__delattr__(self, name): Called when deleting an attribute.\n",
    "Container-like Behavior:\n",
    "\n",
    "__len__(self): Defines the behavior of len() for the object.\n",
    "__getitem__(self, key): Enables accessing elements like obj[key].\n",
    "__setitem__(self, key, value): Enables setting elements like obj[key] = value.\n",
    "__delitem__(self, key): Enables deleting elements like del obj[key].\n",
    "Callable and Context Management:\n",
    "\n",
    "__call__(self): Allows an instance of the class to be called like a function.\n",
    "__enter__(self): Called when entering a with statement block.\n",
    "__exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb): Called when exiting a with statement block."
